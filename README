| Easy_format: indentation made easy |
+------------------------------------+


Introduction
============

This module offers classic C-style indentation.
It provides a simplified interface to 
the Format module of the standard library.

Input data must be first modelled as a tree using 3 kinds of nodes:
- atoms
- lists
- labelled nodes

Atoms represent any text that is guaranteed to be printed as-is.
Lists can model any sequence of items such as arrays of data
or lists of definitions that are labelled with something 
like "int main", "let x =" or "x:".



Indentation rules
=================

Indentation is performed using ASCII space character, 
and whitespace as produced by the Format module.
The current implementation uses reasonable characters: ASCII space ' '
and ASCII line feeds '\n' although the output functions may perform 
a conversion, i.e. convert "\n" into "\r\n" on Windows out_channels opened
in text mode.

No strict indentation rules are guaranteed. The target language, if any,
is assumed to treat any sequence of whitespace characters 
between nodes as insignificant.


Examples

Complete, executable examples are provided with the distribution.
